# SciVerse - 3D Science Model Scanner

A Flutter mobile application that uses camera-based text recognition to identify scientific terms and display corresponding 3D science models with detailed descriptions.

## üî¨ What it does

SciVerse transforms your mobile device into an intelligent science learning tool. Simply point your camera at text containing scientific terms from physics, chemistry, or biology, and the app will:

1. **Scan and recognize text** using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
2. **Identify scientific keywords** from the detected text
3. **Display relevant 3D science models** with visual representations
4. **Provide educational descriptions** for each identified concept
